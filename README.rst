clarent is the home of the shared parts between merlin_ and arthur_.
It is built as part of Crypto 101, the introductory book on
cryptography.

Whence the name?
================

First, the server side to this is called merlin_, because the
step-by-step oracle-like model reminded me of Merlin in the AM
complexity class and `Arthur-Merlin protocols`_. Arthur was named
afterwards, since it's the other side of the Arthur-Merlin protocol. I
decided to keep the trend; Clarent was King Arthur's ceremonial sword.
